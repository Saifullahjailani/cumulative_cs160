### Note:
This project is about iterative design loop, delivering and receiving constructive, actionable design critiques, practicing paper-centric prototyping skills, and Practice programming prototyping skills. 
Please refer to `Project 1 Â· Terrain Trekkers.pdf` for project brief, and `Report.pdf` for detailed report on design process. 

For further detail on the design cycles review files in `Project Docs` directory. 

### How to Run
Check to see if you can run  ``$ node -v`` and ``$ npm -v`` (My versions are v16.15.0 for node and 8.10.0 for npm.)
* 1. Install the Express module using npm. 
ex: ``$ npm install express``
* 2. Run the example app using Node:
ex: ``$ node App.js``

     You should see the message ``Server is running on http://localhost:8000``

     If you instead see an error message like ``Error: Cannot find module 'express'`` -- see step 3. 
* 3. View your website
Open a web browser (e.g. Google Chrome) to this URL: ``http://localhost:8000/``

You should see a delicious and fabulously designed website! Nice!

Edit the **HTML files** and the **CSS stylesheet** to make them your own!
