### Setup
1. [Make sure you have Node and npm installed.](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) 
   Check to see if you can run  ``$ node -v`` and ``$ npm -v`` (My versions are v16.15.0 for node and 8.10.0 for npm.)
1. Install the Express module using npm. 
   ex: ``$ npm install express``
1. Run the example app using Node:
   ex: ``$ node App.js``

   You should see the message ``Server is running on http://localhost:8000``

   If you instead see an error message like ``Error: Cannot find module 'express'`` -- see step 3. 
1. View your website
   Open a web browser (e.g. Google Chrome) to this URL: ``http://localhost:8000/``

   You should see a delicious and fabulously designed drawing app! Nice!

### Brief
This project explores the following brief using academic design process which could be explored in `Report.pdf`. 
```
Think about how you feel when you are in
front of a blank piece of paper or a blank canvas. Do you have any goals in mind? Where do
you begin? What constitutes success? To explore these issues around creativity support
tools, we'll be making an interactive drawing tool application.
```
